# ♠️ Blackjack Game ♠️
This is a project from a Python boot camp challenge. It is a simple implementation of the popular card game, Blackjack.

## Rules
In this game, the deck is unlimited, and there are no jokers or face cards (only the numbers). The goal of the game is to beat the dealer by having a hand that is worth more points than the dealer's hand, without going over 21 points.

Here are the rules of the game:

Each player is dealt two cards to start.
Players can ask for additional cards ("hit") until they decide to "stand" or their hand exceeds 21 points ("bust").
Once all players have finished their turns, the dealer reveals their second card and hits until they have a total of at least 17 points.
The player with the highest hand value without exceeding 21 points wins.
